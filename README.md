# JMC Scanvan
This Lethal Company mod adds an 'new' vehicle; the Scanvan! to the terminal for `480` credits. It is a 2 door luton-style van with an enclosed roof, an ideal alternative to the Cruiser!

Thunderstore link:
erm I don't have one yet lmao

## Features
* Three seats
* Enclosed roof + reworked enemy protection
* Working gauge cluster (speedometer, tachometer, dashboard warning lights, etc)
* Functional side and center rear view mirror
* A functional live radio system (RadioFurniture in your truck!) (Disabled by default, disable the DMCA-Music config to enable this)
* Fun interactables such as electric windows, sunvisors, hazard warning lights, etc!
* **10** default radio tracks (DMCA-free)
* Custom SFX's and some custom animations!
* An incomplete manual that I'm too lazy to redo
* Functional climate control (LethalElements compatability)
* ...other things?

## Compatibility
* Should mostly be compatible with any other vehicle mods, also compatible with CruiserTunes (disable DMCA-Free music)
* Not compatible, but will not break or cause issues with:

- LategameCompanyCruiserUpgrades
- CruiserImproved
- BetterVehicleControls
- CruiserAdditions
- CompanyCruiserSteeringFix (wouldn't even be needed anyways)
- BetterCruiserSync
- 2 Story RV Cruiser

* Mods that will cause issues/do not work with the Scanvan:
- CruiserSkin
- CruiserMap
- LCVR (this will be implemented in the future)

Some mods listed may have partial or full self-implementation, such as BetterVehicleControls keybinds, or configs such as automatically centering steering wheel.
